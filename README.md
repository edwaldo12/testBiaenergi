question 1 
1.from the code above it's not multiplying the number given but it's just add the number in the total into x is zero
2.from the code above there's nothing wrong in it multiplying the number could also doin with always add the number in the total
3.positive integers like (5,3) or zero (0,100) and negative integers like (-5,10) 
but for me the main variable is x
4.what concern me is there's no validation for arguments passed to this function 
so if we passed string in it we should check it is integers or etc

question 2
column 1 = there's 1 column and 1 row all name is Thomas
column 2 = there's 2 columns and 2 row for first row is all thomas name and second row is cindy and null
column 3 = 4 row and 2 column it display thomas and thomas, cindy and thomas, thomas and francois and cindy also francois (this is the bad query for displaying customer)

question 4
in case 1 the performance is better because it iterate bagA to bagB 
if we talk about time complexity it was like this O(bagA * bagB) because bagB is small then it's okay
in case 2 it's vice versa of the case 1 then it will takes long times finishing the process

for improving performances in python we could use set in this case
so the time complexity is O(bagB) so it's efficient for case 1 and 2
